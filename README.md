# CLIProxyAPI-Rust

**All your AI subscriptions. One fast API.**

A single Rust binary that exposes OpenAI, Anthropic and Gemini compatible endpoints, backed by the accounts you already pay for:<br>
Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Antigravity, Grok, Kimi, Meta, Devin and Vertex AI.<br>
Point Claude Code, Codex, your editor or any SDK at one URL and stop caring which account answers.

## Why CLIProxyAPI-Rust

- **One small binary.** About 8 MB with the dashboard inside, around 13 MB of memory in our tests. No Docker, no Node, no runtime to install.
- **Any model from any tool.** Use GPT inside Claude Code, Claude inside Codex, or Gemini behind the OpenAI SDK. Requests are translated between formats automatically. When the client and the provider already speak the same format, the request passes through untouched.
- **Ten providers.** Subscription sign-in for Claude, ChatGPT (Codex), Antigravity, Grok, Kimi, Meta and Devin; service accounts for Vertex AI; API keys for Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Vertex, Kimi, xAI, Meta and anything OpenAI-compatible.
- **Images and video too.** `/v1/images/generations` and `/v1/images/edits` work with ChatGPT accounts, OpenAI and xAI keys, Vertex Imagen and Gemini image models. xAI video generation is behind `/v1/videos`.
- **WebSockets.** Codex WebSocket sessions are relayed to ChatGPT's own WebSocket upstream, so `previous_response_id` works on the server side. Switch to a Claude or Gemini model mid-session and CLIProxyAPI-Rust carries the conversation over.
- **Many accounts, no babysitting.** Each request goes to the account with the most quota left, using the 5-hour and weekly usage Claude and ChatGPT report. An account whose limit is used up sits out until it resets, a rate limit cools down only that model on that account, failed requests move to the next account, and OAuth tokens refresh themselves.
- **A dashboard you'll actually open.** Pure black, live over WebSocket: every subscription's 5-hour and weekly limits side by side, traffic, cooldown timers, sign-in flows, a request log and a config editor.
- **Drop-in for CLIProxyAPI users.** Same credential files, same `config.yaml` (both of its layouts), same Docker paths and flags. Swap the image and keep everything else.

## Quick start

**1. Get the binary.** Download it for macOS, Linux or Windows from [Releases](https://github.com/IuCC123/CLIProxyAPI-Rust/releases/latest), or build it with Rust 1.88 or newer:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/IuCC123/CLIProxyAPI-Rust
```

Or run it with Docker (for amd64 and arm64):

```sh
touch config.yaml && mkdir -p auths
docker run -d --name cliproxyapi-rust -p 8317:8317 \
  -v ./config.yaml:/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml -v ./auths:/root/.cli-proxy-api \
  ghcr.io/iucc123/cliproxyapi-rust
```

**2. Start it.**

```sh
cliproxyapi-rust
```

The first run writes a commented `config.yaml` in the current directory and serves everything on `http://127.0.0.1:8317`. That address is also the dashboard.

**3. Add an account.** Click **Connect account** in the dashboard, or use the terminal:

```sh
cliproxyapi-rust login claude        # Claude Pro / Max
cliproxyapi-rust login codex         # ChatGPT Plus / Pro / Team
cliproxyapi-rust login antigravity   # Google account with Antigravity
cliproxyapi-rust login xai           # SuperGrok / X Premium (shows a code to confirm)
cliproxyapi-rust login kimi          # Kimi Code (shows a code to confirm)
cliproxyapi-rust login meta          # Meta Muse (shows a code to confirm)
cliproxyapi-rust login devin         # Devin / Windsurf
cliproxyapi-rust login vertex --file key.json --location global   # Vertex AI service account
```

API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Vertex, Kimi, xAI, Meta, OpenRouter, Ollama, …) can be added from the dashboard or in `config.yaml`.

## Coming from CLIProxyAPI

Your config, your sign-ins and your Docker setup carry over as they are.

**Docker.** Keep your `docker-compose.yml`, `config.yaml` and `auths/` folder. Add one line to the `.env` next to the compose file and restart:

```sh
echo "CLI_PROXY_IMAGE=ghcr.io/iucc123/cliproxyapi-rust:latest" >> .env
docker compose up -d
```

The image uses the same paths (`/CLIProxyAPI/config.yaml`, `/root/.cli-proxy-api`) and port, and `./CLIProxyAPI` still works inside the container. To go back, delete the line.

**Binary.** Point it at your existing file: `cliproxyapi-rust --config /path/to/config.yaml`. CLIProxyAPI's flags work too: `-config`, `-claude-login`, `-codex-login`, `-antigravity-login`, `-kimi-login`, `-xai-login`, `-meta-login`, `-devin-login`, `-vertex-import`, `-no-browser`.

**Check before you switch.** This prints the accounts it found per provider, where it will listen, and any settings it will ignore, without starting the server:

```sh
cliproxyapi-rust --config config.yaml check
```

| From CLIProxyAPI | |
| --- | --- |
| Credential files in `auth-dir` | Read and written in the same format, for every provider |
| `config.yaml` | Both layouts: v8 (`server:`, `access:`, grouped `api-keys:`) and the older flat one |
| Client keys, management key (plain or bcrypt-hashed), `allow-remote`, TLS, proxy, routing strategy, retries | Used as is |
| API keys for Claude, Codex, Gemini, Vertex, xAI, Meta and OpenAI-compatible providers | Used with their `base-url`, `proxy-url` (including `direct`), `headers`, model aliases, `prefix` and `excluded-models` |
| `oauth-model-alias`, `oauth-excluded-models`, per-file `prefix` and `model_aliases` | Used as is |
| Payload rules, plugins, Redis usage queue, weighted routing, session affinity, the `/v0/management` API | Not supported. The built-in dashboard replaces the separate management panel. |

Changes made from the dashboard keep your file's layout and every setting this binary doesn't use, so you can switch back at any time. Rewriting a file drops its YAML comments, so the first change saves the original as `config.yaml.bak`.

## Connect your tools

**Claude Code**

```sh
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8317
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=<one of your api-keys, or anything if you set none>
claude
```

Want GPT in Claude Code? `export ANTHROPIC_MODEL=gpt-6-astra`.

**Codex** in `~/.codex/config.toml`

```toml
model = "gpt-6-astra"
model_provider = "cliproxyapi-rust"

[model_providers.cliproxyapi-rust]
name = "CLIProxyAPI-Rust"
base_url = "http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1"
wire_api = "responses"
env_key = "CLIPROXYAPI_RUST_KEY"   # only needed if you set api-keys
```

**OpenAI SDK**, or any tool with a custom OpenAI base URL

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1", api_key="<key>")
client.chat.completions.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-5-5",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}],
)
```

**curl**

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/messages \
  -H "x-api-key: <key>" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gemini-3.8-flash", "max_tokens": 512, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Speaks |
| --- | --- |
| `POST /v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions |
| `POST /v1/responses` · `GET /v1/responses` (WebSocket) | OpenAI Responses |
| `POST /v1/responses/compact` | Responses compaction (ChatGPT, xAI) |
| `POST /backend-api/codex/responses` (+ WebSocket) | Codex's native path |
| `POST /v1/messages` · `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` | Anthropic Messages |
| `POST /v1beta/models/{model}:generateContent` · `:streamGenerateContent` | Gemini |
| `POST /v1/images/generations` · `POST /v1/images/edits` (JSON or multipart) | OpenAI Images |
| `POST /v1/videos/generations` · `/edits` · `/extensions` · `GET /v1/videos/{id}` | xAI video |
| `POST /v1/completions` | Legacy OpenAI completions |
| `GET /v1/models` · `GET /v1beta/models` | Model lists |

Clients authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer`, `x-api-key`, `x-goog-api-key` or `?key=`.

### Providers

| Provider | Sign-in | Models | Speaks upstream |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude | OAuth (Pro / Max) or API key | `claude-*` | Anthropic Messages |
| Codex / ChatGPT | OAuth (Plus / Pro / Team) or OpenAI API key | `gpt-*`, `o*`, `codex-*`, `gpt-image-*` | Responses (+ WebSocket) |
| Gemini | API key | `gemini-*`, `gemma-*` | Gemini |
| Vertex AI | Service account or express API key | `gemini-*`, `imagen-*` | Gemini |
| Antigravity | Google OAuth | Gemini and Claude models such as `gemini-3.8-flash-high`, `claude-opus-4-6-thinking` | Cloud Code (Gemini) |
| Grok (xAI) | Device code (SuperGrok / X Premium) or API key | `grok-*`, `grok-imagine-*` | Responses |
| Kimi | Device code (Kimi Code) or API key | `kimi-*` | Chat, Anthropic or Responses, whichever the client speaks |
| Meta | Device code or API key | `muse-*` | Responses |
| Devin | OAuth (Devin / Windsurf) | Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek and SWE models | Connect protobuf |
| OpenAI-compatible | API key or none (OpenRouter, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, …) | whatever you list, with optional aliases | Chat Completions |

Model names are forgiving: `gpt-6-1-sol` finds `gpt-6.1-sol`, and `gemini-3-8-flash` finds Antigravity's `gemini-3.8-flash-high` when that's the account you have.

When more than one provider has a model, the vendor's own accounts answer first and Antigravity or Devin take the overflow when those are rate limited. To choose a provider yourself, prefix the model: `antigravity/claude-sonnet-4-6`, `devin/gpt-6-astra`, `vertex/gemini-3.1-pro`.

### Reasoning effort, from the model name

Append an effort level or a token budget to any model:

```text
gpt-6-astra(high)                  effort level
claude-opus-5-5(max)               adaptive thinking at max effort
claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929(16000)  thinking budget in tokens
gemini-2.5-pro(0)                  thinking off
```

### Images

```sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8317/v1/images/generations \
  -H "authorization: Bearer <key>" -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-image-2", "prompt": "a lighthouse at night, film photo", "size": "1536x1024"}'
```

`gpt-image-*` runs on a ChatGPT account through Codex's image tool (or an OpenAI key), `grok-imagine-*` on xAI, `imagen-*` on Vertex, and Gemini image models such as `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` on Gemini, Vertex or Antigravity. Image models also work in chat: the picture comes back as an image part in whatever format the client speaks.

## The dashboard

Everything is served from the binary at `/`, with no external requests.

## Configuration

`config.yaml` reloads automatically when it changes, and the dashboard edits the same file.

```yaml
host: "127.0.0.1"             # 0.0.0.0 to expose it (set api-keys first)
port: 8317
auth-dir: "~/.cli-proxy-api"  # OAuth credential files, shared with CLIProxyAPI
api-keys: ["sk-pick-anything"] # keys your clients must send; empty = open
management-key: ""            # empty = dashboard only from localhost
proxy-url: ""                 # optional http://, https:// or socks5:// upstream proxy
request-retry: 3              # accounts to try before giving up
routing: least-used           # most quota left first; or round-robin, fill-first
codex-websockets: true        # native WebSocket relay to ChatGPT
claude-cloak: true            # present non-Claude-Code clients as Claude Code on OAuth accounts

claude-api-key:
  - api-key: "sk-ant-..."
codex-api-key:
  - api-key: "sk-..."
gemini-api-key:
  - api-key: "AIza..."
vertex-api-key:               # Vertex express mode (service accounts go in auth-dir)
  - api-key: "AQ..."
kimi-api-key:
  - api-key: "sk-kimi-..."    # Kimi Code; Moonshot platform keys need base-url
xai-api-key:
  - api-key: "xai-..."
meta-api-key:
  - api-key: "..."
openai-compatibility:
  - name: openrouter
    base-url: "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
    api-keys: ["sk-or-..."]
    models:
      - name: "moonshotai/kimi-k3"
        alias: "kimi-k3"
  - name: ollama
    base-url: "http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1"
    models:
      - name: "qwen3-coder:30b"
```

### Running it on a server

Set `host: "0.0.0.0"`, an `api-keys` entry for your clients, and a `management-key` for the dashboard. In Docker the dashboard also needs a `management-key`, because browser requests reach the container from outside `localhost`. Then keep it running, for example with systemd:

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/cliproxyapi-rust.service
[Unit]
Description=CLIProxyAPI-Rust
After=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/cliproxyapi-rust --config /etc/cliproxyapi-rust/config.yaml
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

To sign in accounts on a server, open the dashboard, click **Connect account**, approve in your browser, then paste the `localhost` URL the browser lands on (it won't load, which is expected). Grok, Kimi and Meta use device codes, so they work from anywhere with nothing to paste. `cliproxyapi-rust login <provider>` on the server works the same way.

## How it works

```text
client request ──parse──▶ shared request model ──build──▶ provider request ──▶ upstream
client stream  ◀─render── shared event stream  ◀─parse─── provider stream  ◀──┘
```

Each wire format (`src/formats/{chat,responses,claude,gemini}.rs`) knows how to parse requests, build requests, decode streams and render streams. Adding a format means writing four functions instead of a translator for every pair.

| File | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `src/proxy.rs` | Picks an account, translates, retries on the next account, streams back, records usage |
| `src/ws.rs` | Responses over WebSocket: native Codex relay, or local history for other providers |
| `src/upstream.rs` | Per-provider URLs and headers, including the request shape Claude OAuth accounts expect |
| `src/accounts.rs` | Credential files, API keys, routing and cooldowns |
| `src/oauth.rs` · `src/device.rs` | Browser and device-code sign-in, token refresh for every provider |
| `src/antigravity.rs` · `src/schema.rs` | Cloud Code envelope, project onboarding and the JSON Schema down-leveller it needs |
| `src/devin.rs` | Devin's Connect protobuf: request encoding, stream decoding, model ids |
| `src/vertex.rs` | Service account JWT signing |
| `src/media.rs` | Image, video and compaction endpoints |
| `src/compat.rs` | CLIProxyAPI's config layouts, in-place config edits and command-line flags |
| `ui/` | The dashboard: plain HTML, CSS and JS, compiled into the binary |

## Compared with CLIProxyAPI

CLIProxyAPI-Rust is a smaller rewrite of [CLIProxyAPI](https://github.com/router-for-me/CLIProxyAPI), not a port.

| | CLIProxyAPI-Rust | CLIProxyAPI |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Rust, one binary | Go |
| Dashboard | Built in | Separate web panel |
| Codex WebSockets | Yes, native relay | Yes |
| Claude, ChatGPT, Antigravity, Grok, Kimi, Meta, Devin sign-in | Yes | Yes |
| Vertex service accounts, API keys, OpenAI-compatible | Yes | Yes |
| Images, xAI video, Responses compaction | Yes | Yes |
| Go plugins, Redis usage queue | No | Yes |
| Credential files, config, Docker image layout, CLI flags | Compatible with CLIProxyAPI's | — |

Plugins are Go shared libraries loaded into CLIProxyAPI's process, and the Redis queue feeds its separate usage service. Neither applies to a single Rust binary that keeps its own stats.

## FAQ

**Is this allowed?** CLIProxyAPI-Rust is not affiliated with Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI, Moonshot, Meta or Cognition. Using subscription accounts through third-party tools may be against a provider's terms, and providers can rate-limit or suspend accounts. You are responsible for how you use it.

**Does it work with my CLIProxyAPI setup?** Yes. See [Coming from CLIProxyAPI](#coming-from-cliproxyapi): credential files, both config layouts, the Docker image paths and the command-line flags all carry over. Run `cliproxyapi-rust check` to see exactly what it picks up.

**Where are my credentials stored?** In `auth-dir` (`~/.cli-proxy-api` by default), one JSON file per account, written with `0600` permissions. Nothing leaves your machine except requests to the providers you use.

**Does it phone home?** No. There is no telemetry and the dashboard loads no external assets.

**Claude sign-in fails or gets blocked.** Some Anthropic endpoints sit behind bot protection that CLIProxyAPI works around with a browser TLS fingerprint. CLIProxyAPI-Rust uses standard rustls. If token exchange fails for you, please open an issue with the error from the dashboard.

**Are usage stats saved?** They're kept in memory and reset when CLIProxyAPI-Rust restarts.

## Development

```sh
cargo test            # translator and protocol tests
cargo clippy --all-targets
cargo run -- --config dev.yaml
```

The dashboard lives in `ui/` and is embedded with `include_str!`, so rebuild after editing it.

## Local archive writes

The local request archive serializes and writes records on one dedicated thread. Request workers enqueue records without waiting for disk I/O. A 64 KiB buffer reduces small writes, and the writer preserves admission order.

The queue allows 1,024 records and a conservative 64 MiB estimate of owned record memory, including the record being written. Payloads may use 960 records and 60 MiB; the remaining capacity is reserved for request summaries. Individual records above 16 MiB or nested deeper than 128 levels are dropped. If the queue fills, records are dropped rather than blocking request workers.

The management overview exposes archive queue size, written records, dropped payloads, dropped summaries, and write errors. Live request totals remain independent of archive coverage. A queued record is not yet durable: the writer flushes each record and calls `sync_all` for summaries. Normal server shutdown drains accepted records and can wait for disk I/O. A crash can lose queued records; a partial write can leave an incomplete JSONL tail.

Run the synthetic scheduler comparison with `cargo test --locked archive_scheduler_probe -- --ignored --nocapture`. Recorded debug-build results are in `diagnostics/background-archive-writer.json`; they measure scheduler delay under synthetic archive traffic, not model TPS.
